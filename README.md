# LibrarySearch
Utils for searching a local library system

This is currently just a simple powershell script that will take an ISBN and the name of a 
[MCPL](http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/library/) library location, and will check to see 
if there are any editions of that book available at the specified library.
