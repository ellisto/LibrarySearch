# LibrarySearch
This is a utility that will take an ISBN and the name of a 
[MCPL](http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/library/) library location, and will check to see 
if there are any editions of that book available at the specified library.

There are two implementations: powershell and javascript.

The javascript implementation is pretty rough (js is not my usual language), but will eventually 
be incorporated into a chrome extension that can integrate with goodreads, amazon etc. to
automatically check for availability of books at the local library.
